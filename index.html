                There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” An adventure is something challenging,
                 that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to try new things. The definition of adventure varies from person to person.
                  It can best be described as, “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also be dangerous or in favour.”
